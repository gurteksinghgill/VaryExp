## Significance and Novelty of this paper

Anomalous diffusion is an extensively researched topic in statistical, computational and applied physics: on average, every weekday a new publication with the phrase "anomalous diffusion" is indexed on Scopus.  As the majority of works is applied and uses fractional diffusion, it is important to deliver algorithms calculating probability densities for such systems.

Besides fractional, there are tempered fractional, variable order and distributed order fractional diffusion equations. The literature on computational algorithms for these systems is fragmented, which constitutes a major hurdle for applied scientists.

This paper provides one go-to algorithm for all of the above systems. If a researcher wants to apply it, she only needs a working knowledge of Langevin Equations. Moreover, the paper explores anomalous diffusion problems which so far haven't been amenable to computations of probability densities: variable distributed order fractional differential equations which model of interfaces; subordinated diffusion with temporal drift; and the calculation of probability densities for any inverse subordinator.
